            <p class="content__content">
                Clicom is the final project that was completed during my time enrolling in Google UX Design Certificate. Clicom is a Malaysia-based community service mobile app and responsive website focuses on advertising local community services. The community needs a platform that helps people acknowledging the current activities  that are happening in town.
            </p>
            <p class="content__content">
                Clicom’s primary target users include college students and adults who wanted to be involved in volunteering to their local community services. The goal of this project is to design a platform that will become a hub for advertising local community services to allow communities to stay alert on upcoming programs.
            </p>
            <h1 class="project__overview">Project Duration</h1>
            <p class="content__content">May - June 2023</p> 
            <h1 class="project__overview">Role</h1>
            <p class="content__content">UX designer leading the app and responsive website design from conception to delivery. </p>
            <h1 class="project__overview">Responsibilities</h1>
            <p class="content__content">Conducting interviews, paper and digital wireframing, low and high-fidelity prototyping, conducting usability studies, accounting for accessibility, iterating on designs, determining information architecture, and responsive design.</p>
            <h1 class="project__overview">User Research</h1>
            <p class="content__content">I conducted an early interview earlier in the project to understand user’s opinion and knowledge on local community services. Most of the interview participants stated that local community services does not advertise their activities publicly, making them not aware on current activities conducted in the community.  The feedback received through user research made it clear that some of the users are actually interested in joining and taking part in their community services but are not aware on upcoming events and activities, thus making these programs are not receiving good response.</p>            
            <h1 class="project__overview">User Persona</h1>
            <p class="content__content">Based on my research, I concluded that there were only 1 key user type that my design tried to solve problems for. Ahmad is a full time student who needs latest information regarding local community services because they does not want to miss out some great opportunities especially programs that interests them.</p>

            <h1 class="project__overview">Starting the Design</h1>
            <p class="content__content">I started ideating on my design by doing 'Crazy Eights Exercise', a quick ideation exercise to come up with ideas on the user flow and improving the gaps identified in the competitive audit. My focus during this process was advertising local community services and steps for users to join. After ideating and drafting some paper wireframes, I created the initial designs for the Clicom Community Service app. These designs focused on delivering important information about local community services to the users.</p>
